<h1>Hello, world!</h1>

<p>
    This is a .NET 8 Blazor Web App with Global Server interactivity.
</p>

<p>
    We have defined a CascadingAppState component and made it available to all components in the app.
</p>

<p>
    We have also defined a scoped service called StorageService and injected it into Home.razor.
</p>

<p>
    How can we access the CascadingAppState component INSIDE the StorageService?
</p>

<p>
    See the commented code in StorageService to get an idea of what we want to do.
</p>

<button @onclick="GetMessage">Get Message</button>

<p>@Message</p>

@code {

    private string Message { get; set; } = string.Empty;

    [CascadingParameter]
    public CascadingAppState AppState { get; set; }

    void GetMessage()
    {
        Message = storageService.GetMessage();
    }

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        storageService.initialize(AppState);
        AppState.Message = "Hello from Home.razor";

    }
}
